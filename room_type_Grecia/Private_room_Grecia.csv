I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit!

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

  We hope to see you soon!

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

  We hope to see you soon!

According to Greek mythology, the city was given its name as a result of a competition between the Olympian gods, Poseidon and Athena, about who will become protector of the city. The myth goes that Poseidon provided a well with sea water whilst Athena offered an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, as she touched the ground of the sacred rock of the Acropolis. The people of Athens chose Athena as their protector and so the city was named after her. The two gods represent the strength of Athens as a city of wisdom and as a sea power.<br /><br />The Acropolis Select Hotel is located in the Athenian suburb of Koukaki, one of the adjoining neighborhoods that borders the southern section of the Acropolis,Philopappos Hill and the historical district of Plaka.

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

  We hope to see you soon!

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

  We hope to see you soon!

Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!

  We hope to see you soon!
